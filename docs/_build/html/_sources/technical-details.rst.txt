The alpha release of the RADON integrated framework realize a development environment giving access to the repositories of RADON artifacts and to the following RADON tools: `Graphical Modeling Tool <https://winery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/index.html>`_ (GMT), `Verification Tool <https://radon-vt-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ (VT), `Decomposition Tool <https://decomposition-tool.readthedocs.io/>`_ (DT), `Defect Prediction Tool <https://radon-h2020.github.io/radon-defect-prediction-api/>`_ (DPT) and the Delivery Tolchain.
These are the set of actions that can be performed by an authenticated RADON user:

- Create or open (if already created previously) a RADON workspace with a *modeling project* on it, providing access to the shared repositories of RADON artifacts and with the integrated RADON tools enabled;
- Availability of the Graphical Modeling Tool (GMT) to be invoked on the RADON-IDE to model application topologies;
- Availability of the Verification Tool, Decomposition Tool and Defect Prediction Tool that can be invoked by the RADON user to verify CDL specifications on the RADON models, to optimize the deployment of the applications and to find the defects on the Infrastracture as Code (IaC) blueprints, respectively;
- Export of the modelled application in TOSCA’s Cloud Service Archive (CSAR) format for the deployment;
- Start the deployment process of the CSAR by publishing it on the Template Library and by triggering the CI/CD pipeline (i.e. the Jenkins jobs), deploys the CSAR with the `Orchestrator <https://xlab-si.github.io/xopera-docs/>`_;
- Visualization of the deployment result on a browser window.

The above capabilities have been implemented by the customization of the Eclipse Che environment with the realization of a new RADON Stack (i.e a ready-to-go workspace), defining a custom `che devfile <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radon-h2020/radon-ide/master/devfiles/radon/v0.0.1/devfile.yaml>`_ including the following elements:

- A project (named *radon-particles*) that clones in the RADON workspace the TOSCA modeling entities from the `RADON Particles <https://github.com/radon-h2020/radon-particles>`_ GitHub repository;
- The set of *Che plugins* and `Kubernetes components <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/>`_ that have been developed to integrate the RADON tools.

The technical details of the RADON tools integrated and used in the alpha release are listed below:

- *Graphical Modeling Tool*: integrated in the RADON IDE as a Kubernetes component. It enables the users to create, develop, and model TOSCA service templates (i.e. RADON models), representing the applications that are deployed using the RADON Orchestrator. The GMT is able to interact with files and folders from the "modeling project" inside the underlying Che workspace. It offers also the feature to package and save a CSAR of a selected RADON Model to the workspace in order to give the possibility to process it using other RADON tools or deploy it using the RADON Orchestrator.
- *Verification Tool*: integrated in the RADON IDE with a Che plugin and a Kubernetes component. The users are able to run the verify and correct mode of the VT by right-clicking on any file with the extension ".cdl" and clicking on the *Verify* or *Correct* buttons in the resulting context menu. The result of the verification or correction task is then displayed in a new output sub-window.
- *Decomposition Tool*: integrated in the RADON IDE with a Che plugin. It enables the users to access a public service that makes the DT available trough different programs, namely decomposition, optimization and enhancement using REST APIs. A user can perform a right-click on a service template (.yaml) and then click the “Optimize” button in the pop-up menu. After the optimization program completes, the service template is updated according to the optimal deployment scheme, and the minimum operating cost is printed in the “Output” window.
- *Defect Prediction Tool*: integrated in the RADON IDE with a Che plugin. It enables the users to identify potentially defective IaC blueprints. The user can interact with it by right-clicking on a YAML-based Ansible file and click *Run detection*. The results (i.e., the metrics extracted from the script and defect-proneness) are theb displayed in a new active tab.
- *Delivery Toolchain*: a Che plugin has been developed to extend the Eclipse Che GUI with a  command to start the deployment process of a CSAR. The *Deploy* command appears in the command palette when the user selects a CSAR (a file with the .csar extension) within the workspace and makes a right-click on it. During the deployment process the selected CSAR is published to the `Template Library <https://template-library-radon.xlab.si/>`_ through the available API and a remote `Jenkins <https://www.jenkins.io/>`_ job is triggered to fetch the uploaded CSAR and deploy it with the Orchestrator.
