The *RADON-IDE* provides a web-based development environment for multi-user usage and a front-end for the interaction with the RADON framework by enabling the interaction with the RADON tools and the access to the shared spaces of the RADON artifacts (i.e. RADON models).

The RADON development environment is based on the `Eclipse Che <https://www.eclipse.org/che/>`_ technology: an open source developer workspace server which comes with a cloud integrated development environment (IDE) used by developers to create applications without the need to install any software on their local system.

The RADON IDE provides standard functionalities to support development activities (e.g. debugging functionalities and error checking capabilities) along with, according to the RADON methodology, specific capabilities as listed below:

- *Authorization management*: enables the RADON users to receive access to the development environment in order to interact with the RADON framework. 	
- *Manage RADON workspaces*: permits the creation of new RADON workspaces (or open existing ones) having a stack with all the needed tools, plugins and extensions enabled.
- *Manage application blueprints*: allows the RADON users to invoke and use the different RADON tools to manage the application blueprints according to the workflows identified by the RADON methodology.
- *Manage test specification*: permits to define test cases and run them through the invocation of the RADON tools.
- *Deploy application*: allows a RADON user to start the deployment of a blueprint application on the production/testing environment.
